Travelling is something almost everyone wishes they would've done when they we're younger. And if you ask my Aunt Lucy she would tell you that she "didn't have time" or she "was afraid to go alone".. But mainly, apparently it was **too expensive**. But What if it didn't have to be?
Within the recent boom of 3rd party apps offering a cheaper alternative to taxi rides and pricey hotels, AirBnB has remained on the top contender of the list. Allowing 'hosts' to utilize their dusty guest rooms and turn it into a profit the website has increasingly become popular amongst backpackers and travelers on a budget.
I myself got curious on which aspects of an AirBnB contributes towards the price. I was also motivated by my secret goal of finding a potential candidate for my next vacation.

## The Data:

I decided to pull (["AirBnB listings from Tokyo, Kant≈ç, Japan"](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). A week's worth of scraped data from December-30-2020 to January-05-2021. It contained a total of 10859 observations and 73 features.
The features contained Basic listing features (number of beds, maximum guests & amenities) and Host information(URLs, host being 'Superhost', etc). Data cleaning wasn't too hard, the data came in clean as it is. The main challenge i had was to pick which features to use and how to feature engineer them.


## The Models:

After splitting the data and Identifying the baseline. Since it's a regression problem, I primarily used a Ridge Regression model and then began on preparing the other two tree based models; RandomForestRegressor and XGBRegressor.

20 minutes of hyperparameter tuning later the Random Forest Regressor performed best among the three models.

## Communicating Results:

Based on the dataset. The two most distinguishing factors of how much the price of an AirBnB would be are The number of bedrooms and the number of guests that could be accomodated
